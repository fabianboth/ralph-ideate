## The Ralph Loop

The Ralph Loop is a structured brainstorming methodology that cycles through four phases:

1. **Ideate:** Generate and capture ideas
2. **Extend:** Build on and expand promising concepts
3. **Research:** Investigate and validate with real-world data
4. **Scrutinize:** Critically evaluate and challenge assumptions

Then repeat. Each pass deepens understanding rather than forcing premature convergence.

## Features

- **Infinite exploration:** Covers ground systematically rather than pursuing singular solutions
- **Interactive steering:** Inject thoughts and feedback during active processing to redirect focus
- **Verified validation:** Ideas progress through documented phases with structured assessment

## Installation

```bash
uv tool install ralph-idea
```
